    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>NMake is a make utility provided by Microsoft that is used
    for creating automated builds.</p>

    <h2>NMake Links</h2>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href=

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to NMake</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin calls the NMake tool via command line
    and passes the user-provided parameters.</p>

    <p>@PLUGIN_KEY@ plugin includes the most important features
    provided by the NMake tool, also allows some extra funcionality
    to make the test more configurable according to specific
    needs.</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow itself provides some advantages like
    parameters checking, easy functionality selection using only
    check boxes or radio buttons, hitorical log reports, procedure
    duration statistics, simple credentials attachment, real time
    analysis of the log been generated, among others.</p>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against version present
    on Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.</p>


    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>
      IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
      parameters are shown in <span class='required'>bold
      italics</span>.
    </p>

    <div id="runNMake"><a name='runNMake' id=
    "runNMake"></a>

    <h3>Run NMake</h3>

    <p>This procedure allows the input of all necessary parameters
    along with some extra of them to make the test more
    configurable. When the parameters are defined the NMake command
    is created and run into the Commander, displaying at the end
    the result(s) of it. It displays a summary of Warnings if any
    and Build Errors. It also creates a online log file, which
    contains the output generated by the console.</p>

    <p>Nmake.exe builds only specified targets or, if none are
    specified, the first target in the .mak file. The first .mak
    file target can be a pseudotarget that builds other targets.
    Nmake.exe uses .mak files specified with /F; if /F is not
    specified, it uses the .mak file in the current directory. If
    no .mak file is specified, Nmake.exe uses inference rules to
    build command-line targets.</p>

    <p>The CommandFile text file contains command-line input. Other
    input can precede or follow @CommandFile. A path is permitted.
    In CommandFile, line breaks are treated as spaces. Enclose
    macro definitions in quotation marks (" ") if they contain
    spaces.</p>

Unfortunately, I can't tell you what exactly to put here, but it's OK to put what seems like too much! Include both parameter
values and output where appropriate. Use a separate 'h2' header for each example. Under the h2 header try to stay with the style
outline used above where possible.
